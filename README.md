# .seastorm

After a year long journey across the globe, .seastorm artwork finally got published in WebGL.

It uses extensively what's called GPGPU (General Purpose GPU) to make calculations.

## Concept

A system of autonomous agents, following an unknown path, changeable and elusive, dominated by the entropy of noise and chaos. The result is a work resembles the sea during a storm, which knows the Chaos as its only God!

Inspired by The Great Wave Off Kanagawa by Hokusai, the work is real time generative and was initially developed in Processing with Custom GLSL Shaders and OpenGL implementation, using PShader to compile the shaders, and the algorithm involves Flowfields, Perlin noise, physics and flocking systems. It has been first presented on FRAMED* as a 3 minutes video loop and exhibited across the globe (Taiwan, Japan, Netherlands, United States), and is now presented in WebGL edition with the code open sourced, as a Chrome Experiment.

Best experience on Google Chrome web browser.
